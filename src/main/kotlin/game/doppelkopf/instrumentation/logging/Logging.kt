/**
 * Define the [Logging] interface for classes that may want to use a logger.
 * This interface is used as base for the kotlin extension function that provides simple access to an [Logger] from
 * [org.slf4j] using the [LoggerFactory].
 *
 * Create a private property inside your class that will provide the [Logger] instance returned by the [logger] method.
 * This property can then be used to log inside your class, where the logger name is automatically assigned.
 *
 * Example usage, where [Logging] is this interface, and [Logging.logger] is the extension function we define for all
 * implementations of this interface.
 *

 * class SomeClass : Logging {
